            Indonesia keeps driving for more fiscal stimulus with prudent fiscal policy.
             As one of the vehicles, the government is working on to build a credible and realistic budget. Between 2015 and 2016, tax revenue grew 3.5%, 
             which includes the contribution of IDR 109.5 trillion from Tax Amnesty. Indonesia Tax Amnesty, itself, has been named as the worldâ€™s most successful 
             tax program (based on revenue and declared assets). The total asset declared, as of March 31st 2017, amounted to an equivalent of 39.3% of 2016 GDP.
