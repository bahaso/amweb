                        Strengthening tax systems has emerged as a key development priority for the

                        implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). It is recognized that

                        strong tax systems are key for enhancing state building; it is not just how much revenue is

                        raised that matters for development and growth, but also how it is raised.
