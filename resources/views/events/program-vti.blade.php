                            This FGD is held in response to global condition in which values and governance upheld by various key countries in the world have shifted, such as the United Kingdom with its Brexit phenomenon and the United States of America with its new policies under the control of President Donald Trump. It has brought some parties to assume that it was the beginning of New World Order. Although it is still debated, but the shift’s significance cannot be denied because of the absorbing counter/narrative movement of the commnunist countries with its strong belief in economic liberalism which tinkering with economic nationalism rhetorics leading to protectionism.

                            This activity is held to facilitate and respond to the Government of Indonesia’s ambitious plan related to the country’s infrastructure development. The Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia believes that infrastructure is one way to boost Indonesia’s economic growth by contemplating the possibility of middle income trap, as well as growth target in 2017 amounting to 5.1%. Unfortunately, the plan was conflicted with the Government’s budget.

                            Strengthening tax systems has emerged as a key development priority for the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). It is recognized that strong tax systems are key for enhancing state building; it is not just how much revenue is raised that matters for development and growth, but also how it is raised. The establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), along with the expansion of cross-border investment in the ASEAN region, amplifies unwanted side-effects in terms of aggressive tax planning by multinational and regional companies. Simultaneously, the weakness of coordinating efforts by ASEAN tax authorities enables investors to take advantage of that opportunity for tax evasion.
                            The conference will provide a forum to engage policymakers on issues related domestic resource mobilization, including through international tax reforms. The scope and nature of initiatives to address mismatches and loopholes of the current international tax architecture, remaining areas of difficulty, and the challenges of tax competition and coordination will be addressed.

                            The need for infrastructure development in Indonesia is massive, partly due to the archipelagic landscape and the huge population, coupled with its steady economic growth.

                            The government of Indonesia under President Jokowi’s administration has consistently made infrastructure development one of its highest priority. However, the capacity of the government to finance the development of infrastructure through the government budget is limited.

                            Indonesia, during the last decades. The poor socio-economic performance of most Muslim-majority countries has raised a longstanding debate on whether Islam as the “religion of practice” has relationships with socioeconomic growth, or whether there are deeper problems, outside the Islamic values, contributing to lower education, poverty, poor health in the countries, although the Islamic economic principles have been introduced hundreds years ago (Timmer & McClelland 2004).

                            The severe impact of natural disasters has been widely acknowledged by global world, particularly in regions within the “Ring of Fire”, such as the Asia-Pacific. Large disaster events have caused major human, social, economic and financial impacts. APEC, under Finance Ministers Process (FMP), is one of very active organization which producing disaster related initiatives. Vietnam as APEC Chairman has set the APEC 2017 theme of Creating New Dynamism, Fostering Shared Future; and maintained the Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) as one of four main agendas. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance as the fiscal authority puts high concern on the fiscal resilience on managing financial risk of disaster. Incorporating Disater Risk Management (DRM)/DRFI into its fiscal sustainability framework is a necessity, taking into account the limited fiscal space.

                        <p>
                            Based on the need to further enhance its policy in disaster risk financing and to align the DRM into fiscal policy and development planing, Indonesia needs to review its related existing policies to determine the suitable policies in the short, medium and long run. Therefore, This seminar is aiming to provide foundation for Indonesia to implementing integrated DRM and fiscal policy in a holistic approach, with a view to reinventing the disaster risk management framework and its prevailing laws and regulations.

                            The level and growth of urbanization differ considerably by region. Among developing countries, Latin American countries have the highest proportion of their population living in urban areas. But East and South Asia are likely to have the fastest growth rates in the next 30 years including in Indonesia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Experience suggests that if well managed, urban areas promote efficiency and productivity increases through agglomeration effects; foster innovation and the emergence of new ideas; provide job opportunities and the growth of the middle class.

                        <p>
                            However, Population growth, especially due to rural-to-urban migration (urbanization) has led to urban densification and urban sprawl. This condition presents a variety of very complex urban problems; include social, economic and environmental issues. Various problems that occur in urban areas because of those condition are the increasing rate of poor people, limited of the availability of employment rate, and increasing demand for housing.

                        <p>

It will be a sharing experience and initiatives forum related to urbanization issues especially from other East and South Asia countries.
